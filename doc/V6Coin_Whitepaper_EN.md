# V6 Coin: White Paper on the Global Anonymous IoT Economic Protocol Based on the IPv6 Protocol Stack

# Abstract

This white paper proposes V6 Coin, a decentralized native financial protocol built on the IPv6 protocol stack, designed to address the three core pain points of low latency, high anonymity, and broad adaptability in value settlement for global Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Through the "Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) Mapping" technology, V6 Coin achieves native binding between IPv6 addresses and cryptocurrency wallets, constructing a value network where "an address is a wallet and a connection is mining". It innovatively adopts the "Proof of Connection (PoC)" consensus mechanism to replace the traditional Proof of Work (PoW), avoiding energy waste; designs a population-proportioned issuance model, a dynamic self-balanced burning mechanism, and a chip-free secure activation scheme to ensure the fairness of value distribution and device adaptability. V6 Coin will provide an automated value exchange layer for 8.3 billion people and tens of billions of IoT devices worldwide, endow the IPv6 protocol with economic attributes, and promote the implementation of the value Internet in the era of the Internet of Everything.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background: The Disconnect Between IoT and Value Settlement

With the global popularization of the IPv6 protocol (by 2026, the global share of active IPv6 users has exceeded 60%), the Internet is evolving from "connection between people" to "connection between everything". It is estimated that the number of global IoT devices will exceed 75 billion by 2030. One of the core demands of such devices is low-cost, high-frequency micropayment settlement (e.g., data forwarding service fees, edge computing power leasing, value exchange between devices), but existing financial systems and blockchain solutions cannot meet these needs:

- Traditional payment systems (credit cards, third-party payments) have high handling fees and long response delays, making them unable to adapt to the "cent/millimeter-level" micropayment needs in IoT scenarios;

- Mainstream blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum) adopt a random address system, which is completely decoupled from the network communication layer. Devices need to deploy additional wallet software, resulting in high adaptation costs;

- The PoW consensus mechanism consumes enormous energy and is not suitable for low-power IoT devices; PoS and other consensus mechanisms rely on token staking, making it difficult to achieve distributed fair access;

- Existing cryptocurrencies lack anonymity protection and secure activation schemes for IoT devices, which are prone to leaking device physical trajectories, and screenless/low-computing-power devices struggle to complete key management.

## 1.2 Core Objectives

The core objectives of V6 Coin are to build a native value settlement layer for the IPv6 protocol, achieving:

1. Low Latency: Transaction verification and settlement are integrated into the IPv6 data forwarding process, with end-to-end latency controlled within 100ms;

2. High Anonymity: Hiding device physical locations and transaction trajectories through dynamic address switching and ring signature technology;

3. Broad Adaptability: Supporting zero-configuration activation and key management for chip-free, low-computing-power IoT devices;

4. Fairness: Setting the issuance volume based on the global population ratio, and promoting the popularization of the IPv6 network and the circulation of IoT value through economic incentives.

## 1.3 Terminology Definitions

- CGA (Cryptographically Generated Address): An address generated by cryptographic algorithms from a private key to bind the address with identity;

- PoC (Proof of Connection): A consensus mechanism based on a device's IPv6 online status and data forwarding contribution;

- IID (Interface Identifier): A 64-bit IPv6 interface identifier generated by the V6 Coin private key;

- nano-V6: The smallest unit of V6 Coin, where 1 nano-V6 = 10⁻⁹ V6 Coin;

- Dynamic Burning: A value adjustment mechanism that dynamically adjusts the burning rate based on circulation volume;

- Dead Address: A V6 Coin address with no transactions, mining, asset migration, or other activities for 15 consecutive years.

# 2. Related Work and Limitations

Existing solutions combining blockchain and IoT are mainly divided into two categories, both with significant flaws:

## 2.1 Traditional Blockchain Adaptation Solutions

Such solutions use existing blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum as the settlement layer, and realize the connection between IoT devices and blockchains through gateway devices (e.g., the integration of IBM Watson IoT and Ethereum). Core limitations: ① Gateways become single points of failure and performance bottlenecks, unable to support concurrent access of massive devices; ② High transaction latency (Ethereum's average block interval is 15 seconds), unsuitable for real-time micropayments; ③ Devices rely on gateways for identity authentication, with no guarantee of anonymity; ④ Handling fees fluctuate with network congestion, leading to uncontrollable micropayment costs.

## 2.2 IoT-Specific Blockchains

Such solutions customize blockchains for IoT scenarios (e.g., IOTA, Filecoin), adopting DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or improved PoW consensus. Core limitations: ① Adopt custom network protocols, which have poor compatibility with mainstream Internet protocols such as IPv6 and high deployment costs; ② IOTA's "Tangle" mechanism has double-spending risks when the number of devices is small, and security depends on network scale; ③ The address system is unrelated to physical network addresses, resulting in a disconnect between device identity and network location, making it impossible to achieve "connection is value"; ④ Lack of secure activation and key recovery schemes for chip-free devices.

## 2.3 Differentiated Innovations of V6 Coin

V6 Coin does not build an independent blockchain but natively integrates value settlement functions into the IPv6 protocol stack, eliminating protocol layer barriers through "address as a wallet"; adopts the PoC consensus to avoid energy consumption; designs a population-proportioned issuance and dynamic burning mechanism to balance fairness and value stability; optimizes the key management scheme for chip-free devices, filling the gaps in existing solutions.

# 3. Project Vision and Core Principles

## 3.1 Project Vision

V6 Coin aims to break the disconnect between traditional blockchains and the Internet communication layer, endow the IPv6 protocol with intelligent attributes through economic means, and build a distributed economic ecosystem where "every IPv6 address is a value node". Enable 8.3 billion people and tens of billions of IoT devices worldwide to participate in value production, consumption, and exchange through native IPv6 connections without additional adaptation, promoting the upgrade of the Internet of Everything from "information interconnection" to "value interconnection".

## 3.2 Core Principles

- Protocol Compatibility: Do not subvert existing IPv6 protocol standards; implement value settlement functions through extension headers to ensure interconnection with existing network devices;

- Decentralization: No central node control; value settlement and consensus verification are jointly completed by distributed IPv6 nodes;

- Anonymity and Security: Protect the identity privacy and transaction security of users and devices through dynamic address switching, ring signatures, and other technologies;

- Fairness and Inclusiveness: Set the issuance volume based on the global population ratio, lower participation thresholds, and enable every IPv6 device to obtain value incentives fairly;

- Green and Efficient: Adopt the PoC consensus, eliminating the need for high-intensity computing operations, reducing energy consumption, and adapting to low-power IoT devices.

# 4. Currency Supply and Distribution Model

The supply and distribution of V6 Coin take "fair distribution, effective incentives, and value stability" as core objectives, set the total supply with reference to the global population scale, and balance short-term incentives and long-term sustainability through phased release and dynamic adjustment mechanisms.

## 4.1 Total Supply and Precision

- Total Supply Cap: 83 billion coins (83,000,000,000 V6), corresponding to the estimated global population of 8.3 billion in 2026, achieving a baseline quota of "10 coins per capita";

- Minimum Unit: 1 nano-V6 (10⁻⁹ V6), supporting 9 decimal places of precision, which can meet the cent/millimeter-level micropayment needs such as "per 1KB data forwarding" in IoT scenarios;

- Supply Rigidity: The total supply cap is immutable, and all issuance and burning records are verified by distributed nodes and written into an immutable transaction ledger.

## 4.2 Allocation Ratio and Distribution Mechanism

The total supply of V6 Coin is allocated in the following proportions, and all non-mining portions are subject to lock-up periods and release conditions to prevent short-term speculation and concentrated selling:

|Allocation Type|Proportion|Total Amount (Coins)|Distribution Targets|Distribution Mechanism|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Proof of Connection (PoC) Mining|70%|58,100,000,000|Nodes maintaining IPv6 online status and participating in data forwarding (including personal devices and IoT devices)|Phased release with an initial block reward of 100 V6 per block, halved every 4 years, with a block interval of 10 seconds until fully mined; rewards are distributed based on node online weight and data forwarding contribution|
|Infrastructure Rewards|15%|12,450,000,000|Early IPv6 node deployers, gateway developers, and protocol optimization contributors|1-year lock-up period, followed by linear release over 3 years; annual assessment based on node operation stability and network contribution, with unqualified portions returned to the mining reward pool; specific allocation of 15% infrastructure rewards: 7% for open-source code contributors (including protocol optimization, SDK development, and vulnerability fixes), 8% for ecological partners such as gateway developers and device manufacturers; a special developer fund of 500 million coins is established for the Bounty Program (vulnerability bounties and plug-in incentives).|
|Universal Airdrop|15%|12,450,000,000|Newly activated legitimate physical IPv6 devices (subject to device identity verification)|Maximum airdrop of 10 V6 per device, distributed evenly based on "device activation time + regional distribution"; airdropped funds can only be withdrawn after completing 3 valid transactions (e.g., data forwarding payments) to prevent false device fraud|
## 4.3 Issuance Rhythm Control

To avoid excessive early inflation, V6 Coin sets phased issuance caps:

- Years 1-4 (Halving Cycle 1): Annual issuance does not exceed 4.648 billion coins, with a cumulative issuance of 18.592 billion coins;

- Years 5-8 (Halving Cycle 2): Annual issuance does not exceed 2.324 billion coins, with a cumulative issuance of 27.888 billion coins;

- Subsequent Halving Cycles: The issuance rhythm gradually slows down as block rewards are halved until the full 83 billion coins are issued (the expected issuance cycle is 64 years).

# 5. Core Technical Architecture

The core technical architecture of V6 Coin revolves around "native integration with the IPv6 protocol stack", covering four modules: address mapping, consensus mechanism, transaction verification, and key management, to realize the core functions of "connection is mining and address is a wallet".

## 5.1 Address Mapping Mechanism (CGA-Mapping)

V6 Coin abandons the random address generation method of traditional blockchains and adopts Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) technology to achieve native binding between IPv6 addresses and cryptocurrency wallets. The core logic is as follows:

### 5.1.1 Address Structure

An IPv6 address is 128 bits, divided into a 64-bit Network Prefix and a 64-bit Interface Identifier (IID). The V6 Coin wallet address directly reuses the IPv6 address, with the structure defined as:

- Network Prefix (64 bits): Assigned by the ISP or local area network router, representing the geographic/logical network location of the device and immutable;

- Interface Identifier (IID, 64 bits): Generated by the V6 Coin private key through the Ed25519 elliptic curve encryption algorithm, with the calculation logic: IID = Hash(Public Key of Private Key) mod 2⁶⁴;

- Wallet Address Uniqueness: Due to the uniqueness of the private key, each private key corresponds to a unique IID, which forms a unique IPv6 wallet address in combination with the network prefix.

### 5.1.2 Anonymity Assurance: Dynamic Switching of Temporary Addresses

To prevent attackers from tracking device physical trajectories through IPv6 addresses and solve the problem of redundant asset migration caused by high-frequency address changes of mobile IoT devices, V6 Coin supports dual mechanisms of dynamic switching of temporary addresses and logical subnet address pools:

- Switching Logic: Users can manually or automatically (by default every 24 hours) generate new private key fragments, generate a new IID after signature verification with the original private key, forming a new temporary IPv6 address;

- Ownership Proof: All temporary addresses are derived from the core private key, and ownership can be proven through on-chain signatures. Assets can be freely transferred between the core address and temporary addresses, and transfer records are anonymized;

- Privacy Protection: Temporary addresses are only used for external communication and transactions, while the basic address corresponding to the core private key is not exposed externally, effectively hiding the long-term physical trajectory and transaction history of the device;

- Logical Subnet Address Pool Optimization: For mobile IoT devices such as connected vehicles and wearable devices, a "logical subnet address pool" mechanism is introduced—when a device is first activated, it can associate a set of IPv6 prefixes (up to 8) from the same operator/region to form a logical subnet; when switching physical prefixes within the subnet, there is no need to send a "migration proof", only the binding relationship between IID and prefix needs to be updated locally, and a unified logical wallet identity is maintained on the chain; when crossing the logical subnet range, an on-chain asset migration broadcast is triggered, which can reduce the migration frequency by more than 80%, reducing network redundancy and ledger synchronization latency.

## 5.2 Consensus Mechanism: Proof of Connection (PoC)

V6 Coin adopts the "Proof of Connection (PoC)" consensus mechanism to replace the computing power competition of traditional PoW and token staking of PoS, taking the device's IPv6 online status and data forwarding contribution as the core basis for consensus verification, achieving low-energy consumption and high-concurrency distributed consensus.

### 5.2.1 Core Consensus Logic

- Node Eligibility: Any device with a legitimate IPv6 address can become a PoC node after completing zero-configuration activation, with no computing power or token thresholds;

- Contribution Quantification: Node contribution (weight) is determined by the following indicators: ① Continuous online duration (60%); ② Valid data forwarding volume (30%, only counting IPv6 datagrams with "third-party legitimate signatures" or "paid service marks", excluding junk data packets); ③ Network stability (10%, evaluated by packet loss rate);

- Anti-Self-Brushing Traffic Mechanism: Introduce the "Revenue Recovery and Destruction Ratio" rule—forwarding data packets from addresses under one's own name (including core addresses and temporary addresses) is not counted as valid forwarding volume; if high-frequency meaningless data interaction between the same pair of addresses is detected (exceeding normal business thresholds), 1% of the node's current round of mining revenue is deducted as a penalty, and the deducted portion is directly destroyed;

- Block Verification and Generation: A block is generated every 10 seconds by a verification node group consisting of the top 100 nodes by contribution, through a polling mechanism; verification nodes need to verify the legitimacy of transactions (e.g., signature validity, sufficient balance), and broadcast the block to the entire network after verification, while other nodes only need to synchronize the ledger without repeated verification;

- Security Assurance: Introduce a gradient penalty mechanism (sharded reward buffer) to distinguish between malicious misconduct and non-malicious failures, reducing the force majeure risks for honest nodes: ① Minor Violations: If a node is unexpectedly offline due to network fluctuations, temporary hardware failures, or makes a single verification error, only the current round of mining revenue is deducted, and subsequent verification eligibility is not affected; ② Moderate Violations: If the packet loss rate exceeds 30% within 3 consecutive block cycles (30 seconds) or there are more than 5 verification errors, the verification eligibility is suspended for 24 hours, with no mining revenue during this period; ③ Severe Violations: For active misconduct such as forging transactions, launching double-spending attacks, or maliciously tampering with block data, all unwithdrawn rewards are deducted, verification node eligibility is permanently revoked, and evidence of misconduct is publicly disclosed on the entire network; misconduct is reported by other verification nodes through cryptographic proof and enforced after confirmation by DAO consensus.

### 5.2.2 Prefix Anti-Monopoly Mechanism

To prevent a single ISP or institution from brushing mining rewards by controlling a large number of IPv6 addresses (the same network prefix), V6 Coin introduces a prefix anti-monopoly mechanism:

Under the same 64-bit network prefix, the node mining revenue decreases exponentially with the increase in the number of devices, with the revenue attenuation formula: R = R₀ × e⁻ⁿ/₁₀ (where R is the actual revenue per device, R₀ is the benchmark revenue for 1 device under a single prefix, and n is the number of devices under the prefix). When n≥50, the revenue per device approaches 0, effectively curbing centralized mining in computer rooms and ensuring fairness for individual users and small IoT devices.

## 5.3 Transaction Verification and Forwarding Process

V6 Coin's transaction verification is deeply integrated with the IPv6 data forwarding process to achieve low-latency settlement, and a compatibility degradation scheme is designed for real-world network environments:

1. Transaction Initiation: Supports both online real-time transactions and offline delayed transactions: ① Online Transactions: Prioritize embedding transaction information (payer address, payee address, amount, signature) into the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Header and sending it together with the datagram, while initiating a path detection mechanism to verify the support of intermediate devices along the path for the extension header; ② Offline Transactions: When the device is offline, it can sign transaction information with a precise timestamp (second-level) through the "offline signature authorization" mechanism, and the transaction data is encrypted with AES-256 and stored in local Flash, supporting breakpoint resumption;

2. Compatibility Adaptation: If firewalls or intermediate devices that discard extension headers are detected in the path, the "header encapsulation degradation scheme" is automatically triggered, encapsulating transaction data into UDP (port number preset to 38901) or ICMPv6 Echo Request packets for forwarding to ensure transaction reachability;

3. Node Verification: ① Online Transaction Verification: IPv6 forwarding nodes along the path perform lightweight verification of transaction information (signature validity, sufficient balance), forwarding if verified and discarding if failed; degraded encapsulated transactions need to parse UDP/ICMPv6 payloads first before verification; ② Offline Delayed Settlement: When the device resumes networking or approaches the gateway, the gateway automatically detects locally stored offline transactions, broadcasts them to the entire network on its behalf, and attaches the gateway signature (proving transaction integrity) during broadcasting; verification nodes need to additionally verify the validity of the timestamp (the validity period of offline transactions is 7 days by default, and re-signature is required if expired) to ensure transaction timeliness;

4. QoS Mapping Implementation: After verifying the transaction payment voucher, the forwarding node, in addition to completing on-chain bookkeeping, maps the DiffServ field of the data packet to the corresponding service level at the physical layer—paid priority transactions are marked as EF (Expedited Forwarding, DSCP value 101110), ordinary transactions are marked as AF (Assured Forwarding), and unpaid transactions use the default mark, achieving seamless compatibility with the existing network QoS system;

5. Block Packaging: The verification node group collects global transaction information (including three types: standard extension headers, degraded encapsulation, and offline delayed transactions), packages it into a block every 10 seconds, calculates the block hash, and broadcasts it;

6. Ledger Synchronization: After receiving the block, global nodes only need to verify the block hash and the signature of the verification node, without verifying transactions one by one, completing ledger synchronization quickly;

7. Transaction Confirmation: A transaction is confirmed when the block is synchronized by more than 51% of the global nodes, with a confirmation delay ≤30 seconds (3 block intervals); the confirmation time of offline delayed transactions is calculated from the successful broadcast by the gateway.

## 5.4 Key Management and Chip-Free Secure Activation

In response to the current situation where a large number of IoT devices lack hardware security chips, V6 Coin designs a key management scheme of "logical binding and sharded recovery" to achieve zero-configuration activation and secure recovery:

### 5.4.1 Zero-Configuration Activation Process

1. Device Power-On and Networking: When an IoT device accesses the IPv6 network for the first time, it automatically obtains a network prefix;

2. Key Generation: The device generates an Ed25519 asymmetric key pair (private key + public key) using hardware features such as CPU serial number and MAC address as entropy sources through the built-in SDK;

3. Address Generation: A 64-bit IID is generated by computing the public key, which combines with the network prefix to form a complete IPv6 wallet address;

4. Activation Verification: The device broadcasts an activation request to the entire network, and verification nodes perform dual verification—① Hardware feature uniqueness verification (preventing virtual device fraud); ② Proof of Space-Time verification: Measure the network latency between the device and at least 3 distributed verification nodes through a Ping-based triangulation mechanism, combined with rough GPS positioning information (non-mandatory, network base station positioning is used if there is no GPS module) to prove that it has a real physical network location and latency characteristics, preventing the aggregation of virtual nodes cloned by virtualization technology; activation is completed after dual verification, and the device can participate in PoC mining and transactions.

### 5.4.2 Key Backup and Recovery

- Key Backup: After successful activation, the device generates a 12-word mnemonic phrase compliant with the BIP-39 standard (screenless devices synchronize to the mobile App via Bluetooth or local hotspot for backup, while screen-enabled devices display it directly); the mnemonic phrase is the only backup of the private key and is not stored on any network node;

- Asset Migration: When the device is damaged or the network is replaced (network prefix changes), the user regenerates the private key and IID in the new device or new network environment through the mnemonic phrase, and broadcasts an "asset migration proof" (including the original address signature and new address information) to the entire network;

- Recovery Confirmation: After verifying the legitimacy of the migration proof, the verification node group locks the assets of the original address and synchronizes them to the new address. The migration process does not require third-party intervention, and asset security is guaranteed by cryptography.

### 5.4.3 Chip-Free Security Protection

For devices without hardware security chips, private key security is guaranteed through the following methods:

- Local Encrypted Storage: The private key is encrypted with the AES-256 algorithm and stored in the device's local Flash, with the encryption key generated by combining the CPU serial number and a simple password set by the user;

- Software-Defined Security Zone: Utilize the memory isolation mechanism of the device operating system to divide an independent secure memory area, where the private key is only decrypted and used within the secure area and not exposed externally;

- Tamper-Proof Verification: Each time the private key is read, its integrity is verified through hashing. If tampering is detected, the local private key is immediately deleted and can only be recovered through the mnemonic phrase.

# 6. IoT Empowerment Scenarios and Value Realization

Through "economic incentives + native protocol integration", V6 Coin provides diversified value services for IoT scenarios, promoting the popularization of the IPv6 network and the prosperity of the IoT ecosystem.

## 6.1 Core Acquisition Method: PoC Mining Incentives

PoC mining is the main way to obtain V6 Coin, aiming to incentivize devices to maintain IPv6 online status and participate in network construction:

- Personal Devices: Ordinary users' mobile phones, computers, smart home devices (e.g., IPv6 routers, smart TVs) can passively obtain mining rewards by simply maintaining IPv6 online status, with no additional operations required;

- IoT Devices: Industrial sensors, smart electricity meters, connected vehicle devices, etc., can obtain additional mining rewards by participating in data forwarding of other devices while completing their own data transmission;

- Reward Settlement: Mining rewards are settled in real-time per block and automatically transferred to the IPv6 wallet address of the device with no handling fees.

## 6.2 Value-Added Services: Non-Mandatory Value Applications

V6 Coin provides diversified value-added services for coin-holding devices, and part of the tokens consumed by the services enters the burning pool to achieve value regulation:

### 6.2.1 QoS Priority Improvement

When the network is congested, coin-holding devices can request higher QoS priority (e.g., lower forwarding latency, higher bandwidth guarantee) from forwarding nodes by embedding V6 Coin payment vouchers in the IPv6 extension header. The payment amount is dynamically adjusted according to network congestion, with 30% of the handling fee used for burning and 70% distributed to forwarding nodes.

### 6.2.2 IoT Micropayment Settlement

Provide instant settlement services for high-frequency micropayments in IoT scenarios, typical scenarios include:

- Data Transactions: Devices sell sensor data (e.g., environmental monitoring data, industrial production data) to data platforms, with instant settlement completed through V6 Coin, and the handling fee per transaction is as low as 1 nano-V6;

- Computing Power Leasing: Edge computing nodes provide computing power services (e.g., data encryption, AI inference) for low-computing-power IoT devices, with real-time settlement based on computing power usage through V6 Coin;

- Device Sharing: Smart devices (e.g., shared charging piles, shared printers) realize automatic charging by usage duration/times through V6 Coin, without the intervention of a centralized platform.

### 6.2.3 Privacy Relay Services

Coin-holding users can pay fees through V6 Coin to use anonymous relay nodes to forward data, hiding their IP addresses and physical locations. 50% of the handling fee for relay services is used for burning, and 50% is distributed to relay nodes to ensure incentives for relay nodes.

# 7. Dynamic Self-Balanced Burning and Adjustment Mechanism

To prevent inflation, stabilize the value of V6 Coin, and ensure the availability of IoT micropayments, a dynamic self-balanced burning model and a dormant address recovery mechanism are designed to achieve dynamic balance between value supply and demand.

## 7.1 Dynamic Burning Mechanism

The burning rate of V6 Coin is dynamically adjusted according to the global circulation volume, and the burned funds are directly destroyed (private keys are permanently abandoned) and cannot be recovered:

|Global Circulation Range|Burning Rate (Proportion of Handling Fees)|Adjustment Objective|
|---|---|---|
|> 50 billion coins|30%-50% (higher circulation leads to higher burning rate)|Curb inflation, reduce circulating supply, and stabilize coin price|
|2.1 billion - 50 billion coins|10%-30%|Balance inflation and liquidity to meet micropayment needs|
|< 2.1 billion coins|0%-1% (only the minimum burning rate is retained for bookkeeping)|Prioritize ensuring liquidity and avoid insufficient coins for devices due to excessive burning|
The burning rate is adjusted quarterly through democratic governance voting by global nodes via the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to ensure the fairness and rationality of adjustments. The specific governance rules are as follows: ① Contribution-Weighted Voting System: Adopt a dual-weight model of "PoC contribution + coin holding amount", with the voting weight calculation formula:

Voting Weight (W) = PoC Contribution Score (S₁) × 60% + Coin Holding Score (S₂) × 40%

Among them, PoC Contribution Score (S₁) = (Average online duration in the past 90 days / Total duration of 90 days) × 0.6 + (Valid forwarding volume / Average valid forwarding volume of the entire network in the same period) × 0.3 + (1 - Packet loss rate) × 0.1, with a score range of 0-1; Coin Holding Score (S₂) = Average holdings in the past 7 days / Total global circulation, with a score range of 0-1, and the maximum coin holding weight of a single node does not exceed 5% of the total global weight (i.e., S₂×40%≤0.05) to prevent whale manipulation; ② Proposal Threshold: Any address holding 0.01% of the total V6 Coin supply (i.e., 8.3 million coins) or more can initiate proposals for protocol parameter adjustments, technical upgrades, etc., and the proposal must be accompanied by a detailed feasibility study report and technical implementation plan; ③ Voting Effective Conditions: A proposal can only take effect if it is approved by more than 60% of participating voting nodes, and the cumulative PoC contribution of participating voting nodes accounts for more than 50% of the total global contribution; the entire voting process is on-chain, traceable, and immutable.

## 7.2 Dormant Address Recovery Mechanism

For "dead addresses" with no activities (no transactions, no mining, no asset migration) for 15 consecutive years, a fund recovery mechanism is activated:

- Recovery Rhythm: Funds in dead addresses are returned to the national treasury incentive pool at an annual rate of 5% until fully recovered (taking 20 years);

- Use of Recovered Funds: All recovered funds are used to supplement PoC mining rewards and universal airdrops to enhance incentives for active nodes;

- Security Assurance: The determination of dead addresses requires consensus verification by global nodes to ensure that active addresses are not misjudged; if a dead address generates activities subsequently, the unrecovered portion stops recovery immediately to protect user asset security.

# 8. Security and Privacy Protection

V6 Coin builds a comprehensive security protection system from the protocol layer, consensus layer, and application layer to ensure the security of user assets and the protection of privacy.

## 8.1 Transaction Anonymity Assurance

- Ring Signature Technology: Transaction signatures adopt an improved Monero ring signature scheme, mixing the user's transaction signature with other random transaction signatures, making it impossible for external parties to associate the payer address with the payee address through the on-chain ledger;

- Dynamic Address Switching: Through the temporary address mechanism, devices can frequently replace the externally displayed IPv6 address to prevent attackers from tracking device physical trajectories through addresses;

- Transaction Information Encryption: Core data such as transaction amount and payer information are encrypted with AES-256 and embedded in the IPv6 extension header, which can only be decrypted by the payee and verification nodes, and other forwarding nodes cannot obtain transaction details;

## 8.2 Anti-Attack Capability

- Anti-Double-Spending Attack: Through the block confirmation mechanism of PoC consensus, transactions need to be confirmed after 3 block intervals (30 seconds), and the block hash chain is immutable, effectively preventing double-spending attacks;

- Anti-DDoS Attack: The distributed node architecture has no central node, so attackers cannot paralyze the entire network by attacking a single node; at the same time, the massive address resources of IPv6 can disperse attack traffic and reduce attack effects;

- Anti-Sybil Attack: Through hardware feature uniqueness verification and prefix anti-monopoly mechanism, prevent attackers from launching Sybil attacks by forging a large number of virtual devices or controlling a single network prefix.

## 8.3 Protocol Layer Security

- IPv6 Extension Header Verification: Verify the integrity of the IPv6 extension header embedded with transaction information to prevent tampering with transaction information;

- Node Identity Authentication: All verification nodes participating in consensus must complete identity authentication, and nodes that fail authentication cannot participate in block generation and verification;

- Protocol Upgrade Security: V6 Coin protocol upgrades adopt a "soft fork" mechanism to ensure compatibility between old and new version nodes, and the upgrade process requires voting confirmation by global nodes to prevent malicious upgrades.

# 9. Legal Compliance and Censorship Resistance

## 9.1 Technical Neutrality Statement

V6 Coin is corely positioned as a "network optimization and value exchange protocol supporting incentive layer based on IPv6 standards", belonging to the category of underlying technical tools, without the circulation attributes of legal tender, and not classified as regulated financial products such as securities or futures. The protocol itself does not participate in any commercial transaction matching, but only provides a technical channel for value exchange between IPv6 devices. Its anonymity design is mainly to protect the physical trajectories and transaction privacy of IoT devices, rather than evading regulatory requirements such as anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF). The application scenarios of the protocol are independently determined by ecological participants and must comply with the laws and regulations of the regions where they operate.

## 9.2 Optional Compliance Interface: Audit Observation Bit

To meet the compliance audit and data right confirmation needs of commercial institutions, financial institutions, and other entities, the protocol designs an optional "Audit Observation Bit" mechanism without compromising the underlying global anonymity: ① Switch Controllable: The audit observation bit is disabled by default and only takes effect when actively enabled by users/institutions; ② Authorized Scope Limitation: After enabling, enterprise-level users can authorize specific auditors (e.g., regulatory authorities, third-party audit firms) to view transaction flow summaries within a specified time period (minimum granularity of 24 hours) in their own IP segments through on-chain signatures; ③ Privacy Isolation: Auditors can only view statistical transaction amounts and summary circulation paths (excluding complete device addresses and business payloads) within the authorized IP segments, and cannot associate global transaction trajectories or other users' asset information; ④ Permission Recovery: Users can revoke audit authorization at any time through on-chain operations, and authorization records and audit logs are fully on-chain and traceable to ensure compliant operation traceability.

## 9.3 Censorship Resistance Assurance

The core protocol layer adopts a distributed node architecture with no central control node, so no single institution or region can block global transactions; transaction data is anonymized through ring signatures, dynamic address switching, and other technologies to ensure that user privacy is not subject to illegal censorship on the premise of compliance.

- Improve the ecological system and support value applications for more IoT scenarios;

- Promote V6 Coin to become a standard extended function of the IPv6 protocol to achieve global popularization;

- Build cross-chain interoperability standards: deploy native cross-chain gateways based on IPv6 addresses, support seamless Atomic Swaps between V6 Coin and mainstream stablecoins (e.g., USDT) and mainstream cryptocurrencies (BTC/ETH), use IPv6 addresses as cross-chain identity identifiers to solve identity mapping and verification issues in cross-chain transactions, and break closed protocol barriers;

- Continuously optimize protocol performance, improve network concurrency and security, and support the access of 100 billion-level devices.

# 11. Conclusion

V6 Coin is not a subversion of existing Internet protocols but injects value attributes into the IPv6 protocol through economic means, building a distributed value network of "address as a wallet and connection is mining". It solves the core pain points of traditional blockchain adaptation to IoT, realizes low-latency, high-anonymity, and broad-adaptability micropayment settlement, and provides 8.3 billion people and tens of billions of IoT devices worldwide with the opportunity to participate in value exchange fairly.

With the global popularization of IPv6 and the rapid development of IoT technology, V6 Coin is expected to become the native financial protocol of the Internet of Everything era, promoting the upgrade of the Internet from "information interconnection" to "value interconnection", and building a fairer, more efficient, and intelligent global IoT economic ecosystem.
